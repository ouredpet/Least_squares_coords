This is an example of EBL writefield aligment procedure

Generate distorted (transformed) coords system (1st order coordinate transform, but can be increased by function transform_high_order)

Generate measurement marks

Add noise to the postion of the marks

Measure the marks

Estimate the paratemres of the disortion

1/ number unknowns = number knowns
2/ over determined system (linear least squares)

Estmate the inner paramters of the transformation by non linear least square (or analyticaly) for thetas and zooms

Generate the distorted coordinates and plot them

Calculate the error of the estimation
